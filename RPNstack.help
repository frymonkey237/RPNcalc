=General

.Commands are case-insensitive. Variable names, including program variable
.names, and units, are case-sensitive. 

.Variables cannot be given the name of any existing command or program variable.
.However, variables can be given the name of an existing user variable, which
.would just overwrite the previous value of the variable with a new value.
